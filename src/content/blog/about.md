# About Me

I'm **Gurudev "Guru" Ilangovan**, a Data Science Manager at Capital One, focused on **AI and large language models** for the past 2 years. I'm passionate about solving real-world problems through data-driven, tech-powered solutions.

## Professional Background

With over 6 years at Capital One, I've progressed from Senior Data Analyst to Principal Data Scientist and now Data Science Manager, leading initiatives that drive data-powered decision making. Prior to that, I was a graduate research assistant at Texas A&M University, where I earned dual Master's degrees in Computer Science and Industrial Engineering.

My research focused on **machine learning**, **sequential data mining**, and **entity deduplication**, including work on privacy-preserving record linkage systems and sequential analysis of healthcare data for the US Department of Veterans Affairs.

## Skills & Interests

For the past 2 years, I've been deeply focused on **AI and large language models**, working at the intersection of **LLMs**, **generative AI**, and **software development** to build systems that balance technical rigor with practical impact. Beyond work, I'm passionate about **street and landscape photography**, which you can explore in the photography space of this site.
