I'm **Gurudev "Guru" Ilangovan**, a Data Science Manager at Capital One building AI systems with large language models. I solve real problems at the intersection of LLMs, generative AI, and software engineering.


I've spent 6+ years at Capital One, climbing from Senior Data Analyst to my current role leading AI initiatives. Before that, I earned dual Master's degrees in Computer Science and Industrial Engineering from Texas A&M, researching machine learning, sequential data mining, and privacy-preserving record linkage for the US Department of Veterans Affairs.

When I'm not building AI systems, I'm shooting street and landscape photography — check out my work in the [photography](/photography) section.
