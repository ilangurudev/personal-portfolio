Hotel room view. Even without anyone, I loved this view and took several shots of it the day before - it almost seemed like a view from a cruise. 

The next day, I spotted a lady in bright yellow (in a sea of blue, this made her pop). I didn't have my camera on me and was afraid I'd lose the shot in the time it took to grab it. But I did anyway and luckily, got the shot. 

Maybe sometimes, lightning does strike twice in photography.
